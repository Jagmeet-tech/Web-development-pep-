      "1.Hey there, are you wondering if this is the right course? Yes!!!! Just leave every other course on youtube and start watching this series. I tried many python tutorials from all other channels and apps, and even multiple paid courses on Udemy (that I got for free using coupon codes). None of those, I repeat- None of those courses is as good as this series by Mr. Reddy.  He teaches things thoroughly, without missing anything that's necessary He has set up the course to go from lower difficulty to higher You will get all the concepts clearly The main thing: He teaches 'why you should do this' unlike other channels that only teach 'what you should do' He teaches you the logic to fix bugs and errors by showing mistakes (arbitrary) and fixing them.   If you are thinking of learning python, just jump into this course. You won't find anything like this anywhere else.  Thank you Navin Reddy <3 You are one of a kind While True:         print('Thanks for the awesome tutorial series. We love you')",
      "2.Thank you Mr Reddy, for sparing precious time and making free tutorial for everyone.!! Great initiative in an era where education is becoming expensive because of educated people..",
      "3.Loved the fact that you started numbering videos from \"0\" as Python start counting from \"0\".",
      "4.such a great work you are doing!! you explain the background, the method, you develop the thought process in programming- which is the essential thing,,, hats off!!! you are the best...",
      "5.Thanks a million for such an amazing playlist... This is helping me a lot and it's free too... What else do anybody wants ? Again  Thank you so much sir ! 😊 Edit : I forgot to mention... You are the best teacher 😊",
